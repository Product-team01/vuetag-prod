  description: 'This API lists the total number of datasets that have been registered
    in the dataset registry, with its corresponding name and identifiers.

    The goal of this API is to provide the registered datasets in a convenient format
    that allows the user to browse and discover all entries in the registry.


    There is no input required to invoke this API.

    The output of this API is a count of the total number of datasets registered and
    a list of all these datasets in the form of a dictionary - the key of the dictionary
    being the dataset identifier and the value being the name of the dataset.'

  description: 'This API is used to register any data along with metadata configurations
    pertaining to it in the dataset registry.

    While the data exists somewhere in its raw format, the dataset registry helps
    maintain the metadata that is pertaining to this data.

    The dataset registry also helps in isolating and composing datasets as entities
    that can be used to build and orchestrate workflows.


    The input to this API is a payload containing all the metadata about the dataset
    - name, schema, description, univariate analysis and so on.

    The output is a dataset identifier which is a unique reference to this dataset
    in the dataset registry, and a config which is the same as the input along with
    the generated identifier.'

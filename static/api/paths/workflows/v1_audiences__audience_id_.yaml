  description: 'This API allows the user to read metadata configuration pertaining
    to a audience identifier.

    By default, the API provides the latest metadata configuration which is present
    in the audience registry.

    The API also helps capture the end-to-end journey of this metadata by providing
    versioning, and hence captures data lineage in the metadata layer.

    Using the version parameter (which by default points to the latest version of
    the audience), we can obtain different versions of this metadata configuration.


    The input to this API is a audience identifier, which is mandatory. We can pass
    an optional version parameter as well - if not passed, it will point to the latest
    version of the data.

    The output of this API is all the metadata pertaining to the corresponding audience
    identifier.'

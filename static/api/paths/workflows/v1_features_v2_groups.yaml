  description: 'This API lists the total number of feature groups that have been registered
    in the feature registry.

    The goal of this API is to provide the registered feature groups in a convenient
    format that allows the user to browse and discover all feature groups that exist.

    The user can also provide a new feature grouping when creating features, and that
    feature group will be automatically updated in the feature group listing configuration.


    There is no input required to invoke this API.

    The output of this API is a count of the total number of feature groups registered
    and a list of all these feature groups.'

  description: 'This API is used to validate any workflow metadata configurations
    which is passed as the input payload.

    The validations are run for the configurations in which we expect metadata to
    be in the workflows and the nodes that belong to it.

    The API is useful to validate the entries in the workflow (and corresponding nodes)
    at any stage before registering and deploying them to run.


    The input to this API is a dictionary containing all the metadata about the workflow
    - name, description, and any other configurations that drives its functionality.

    If validated, the output will be a success. Else, the errors or failures in the
    validation process will be shown.'

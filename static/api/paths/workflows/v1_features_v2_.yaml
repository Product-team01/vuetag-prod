  description: 'This API lists the total number of features that have been registered
    in the feature registry, with its corresponding name and identifiers.

    The goal of this API is to provide the registered features in a convenient format
    that allows the user to browse and discover all entries in the registry.


    There is no input required to invoke this API.

    The output of this API is a count of the total number of features registered and
    a list of all these features in the form of a dictionary - the key of the dictionary
    being the feature identifier and the value being the name of the feature.'

    pertaining to it in the feature registry.

    The metadata for this feature holds information about the feature and configurations
    about how to orchestrate and compute the feature.

    The feature registry also helps in isolating and composing features as entities
    that can be used as backbones in building audiences.


    The input to this API is a dictionary containing all the metadata about the feature
    - name, description, and any other configurations that drives its functionality.

    The output is a feature identifier which is a unique reference to this feature
    in the feature registry, and a config which is the same as the input along with
    the generated identifier.'

  description: 'This API is the trigger to execute the DAG in synchronous mode using
    pandas and not spark queries.

    This API is meant to be for running lighter workloads and the execution happens
    on the pandasQL framework, which is hosted on nightwing.


    The input to the API is a workflow which has a list of multiple nodes with their
    corresponding configurations.

    The output of the API is a dictionary of every persisted output of the workflow.
    It can be a dataset or a model artifact.'

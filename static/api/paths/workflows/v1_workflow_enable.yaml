  description: 'This API allows the deployment of any specified workflow and make
    it available for execution in an operational environment on asynchronous mode.

    The  API allows reading the latest metadata configuration pertaining to the workflow
    and deploy it as a graph on a target system or workflow execution engine.

    This API communicates with lantern, which in turn, communicates with raven to
    create a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

    This DAG will be deployed on an execution framework (we currently use Airflow)
    - which, when triggered, executes the workflow in a Spark environment.

    This API is a precursor to the /async/run API for workflows to run in async mode.


    The input to the API is a workflow identifier which is a unique reference to this
    workflow in the workflow registry.

    The optional use_case parameter is used in creation of the DAG.


    The output of this API will be a DAG identifier which is a unique reference to
    every DAG created in lantern.'

  description: 'This API is to simplify management of different node types in the
    SDK.

    The functionality of this API is to provide a list of all available node types
    that can be used and integrate in building workflows.

    In the context of the tool environment, this API facilitates management of node
    metadata and configuration that should be user inputs. That information is critical
    in workflow execution and deployment.

    This API helps provide all the details for different types of nodes in terms of
    its functionality.

    It also has different configuration formats for input nodes and any intermediate
    or final output nodes in the workflow.


    There is no input required to invoke this API.

    The output of this API is a response containing all the different types of nodes
    along with metadata fields with its corresponding formats on the tool.'

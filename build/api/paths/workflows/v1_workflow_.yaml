  description: 'This API lists the total number of workflows that have been registered
    in the workflow registry, with its corresponding name and identifiers.

    The goal of this API is to provide the registered workflows in a convenient format
    that allows the user to browse and discover all entries in the registry.


    There is no input required to invoke this API.

    The output of this API is a count of the total number of workflows registered
    and a list of all these workflows in the form of a dictionary - the key of the
    dictionary being the workflow identifier and the value being the name of the workflow.'

  description: 'This API is used to register any workflow along with metadata configurations
    pertaining to it in the workflow registry.

    The metadata for this workflow holds information about the workflow and configurations
    about how to orchestrate and execute the workflow.

    The workflow registry also helps in isolating and composing workflows as entities
    that can be used as backbones in building features and audiences.


    The input to this API is a dictionary containing all the metadata about the workflow
    - name, description, and any other configurations that drives its functionality.

    The output is a workflow identifier which is a unique reference to this workflow
    in the workflow registry, and a config which is the same as the input along with
    the generated identifier.'

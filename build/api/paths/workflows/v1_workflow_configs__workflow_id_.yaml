delete:
  description: 'This API allows the deletion of any specified workflow.

    It has two functionalities - one being the deletion of just the DAG and updation
    of the DAG config, and the other being deletion of the workflow metadata from
    the registry config.


    The input to the API is a workflow identifier which is a unique reference to this
    workflow in the workflow registry.

    The optional confirm_delete parameter is a boolean value that is used by the tool.
    If set to True, it goes ahead and deletes the workflow DAG and metadata configurations.
    If False, it generates a prompt that the user can confirm again.'

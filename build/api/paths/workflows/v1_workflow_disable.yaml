  description: 'This API allows the un-deployment of any specified workflow that has
    previously been deployed on an execution engine.

    The  API releases any compute that was configured during deployment of the DAG.

    This API communicates with lantern, which in turn, communicates with raven to
    undeploy a directed acyclic graph (DAG).


    The input to the API is a workflow identifier which is a unique reference to this
    workflow in the workflow registry.

    The optional use_case parameter is used as a reference for the DAG.'

    - $ref: ../workflows/GenericModelTrainConfig.yaml
    description: This field is a configuration for the model training process itself.
      It represents all the required configurations that the user can provide for
      model training execution.
    title: Config
  dependent_node_ids:
    default: []
    description: This field describes the list of node IDs that are dependent on the
      current node. This is used to build the workflow DAG.
    items:
      type: string
    title: Dependent Node Ids
    type: array
  model_type:
    description: This field describes the nature of the model that will be trained.
      Currently, we support training classification models. We will be extending this
      to include regression models and forecasting models in the upcoming releases.
    title: Model Type
    type: string
  node_id:
    default: ''
    description: This field describes the identifier of the corresponding model training
      node. If it is not present, it will be created.
    title: Node Id
    type: string
  sink_artifact:
    default: ''
    description: This field describes the model artifact output of the corresponding
      model training process. This is tracked in the model registry on execution.
      The artifact contains metadata about the model training process and can be used
      for inference workflows as well.
    title: Sink Artifact
    type: string
  source_dataset:
    description: This field describes the name of the dataset that will be the source
      / input for the model training process.
    title: Source Dataset
    type: string
  train_model:
    description: This field is a boolean field / flag that acts as an identifier for
      model training nodes. It is a required field and has to be True for model training
      nodes.
    title: Train Model
    type: boolean

The VueTag service is available through REST APIs and can be used in a variety of configurations based on the specific requirement. 

In general, there are two modes of usage:

* *Synchronous*: For responses that are required in near-real time. This is typically used when there are individual packets that are sent (serial or through parallel calls) which require tagging results per packet. These typically are used in situations where input is either in the form of streams or when the tagging is part of a larger workflow where the content to be tagged flows through the workflow in a non-batched manner
* *Asynchronous*: For responses that are required in batches - generally not in real-time. This is typically used when large batches of data are to be tagged as a whole and when the data is typically available in files that contain multiple data points that are to be sent for tagging at once. These are typically used in situations where input is a file that is generated by another part of the workflow and which is sent to be tagged as a batch, the results of which are required as a batch for further processing.

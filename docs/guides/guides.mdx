Vue.aiâ€™s product tagging solution, VueTag, helps retailers create detailed tags and product metadata in a matter of minutes - saving a lot of the time and cost involved in manual labour. 
VueTag uses data extraction and data prediction to enhance product data. With AI, it extracts and enriches product data from structured or unstructured visual and textual inputs. The automated process is instant, learns from feedback, and can learn customized tags. It helps save manual effort, time, and resources.
